# Search-review-of-website-douban
The "www.douban.com" is a website which specially collects all kinds of reviews,such as movies' reviews and so on.
This time I use Python and Scrapy to download its book reviews.According to the grade one gives to a certain book,I devide the
relevant reviews into three types:good,bad and review(this type contains both bad and good reviews).
By the way,this code is based on the OSX.So if you want it to run in Windows,please change the path of download in it.
